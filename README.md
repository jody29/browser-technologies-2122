# üç∞ Progressive enhancement

## üëçüèª Core functionality
The core functionality is that the user can customize his own t-shirt, put it in the shopping cart and order it.

### What I had to do
To make sure that the core functionality works no matter what, I had to use as much HTML as I can. Also I had to validate the forms server-side, so it will still work when JavaScript is turned off.

I created a POST request that reads the JSON file and checks if there is allready a shirt existing with the same ID.
<img width="1000" alt="Schermafbeelding 2022-04-07 om 17 42 52" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66092262/162239931-eb3d3b87-71ca-4665-bf33-0279f7701a82.png">

If the there isn't any shirt with the same ID, then it will push the body of the form to the array in the JSON file. This will look like this in the JSON file.

## üëåüèª Usable layer
For the usable layer I added some styling to to my web page. I made sure that the labels had a :focus so that people who have no trackpad or mouse will still be able to use my application. </br>
<img width="286" alt="Schermafbeelding 2022-04-07 om 17 48 26" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66092262/162242929-6904650a-b720-43fa-8627-e0d18c4555cb.png">

Because some browser don't fully support flexbox, I had to make sure that something else would happen if flexbox is not supported.

## ü§§ Pleasurable layer
For the pleasurable layer I added a live preview of the shirt that the user creates. I also made sure that every change that the user makes will be stored in the LocalStorage. So when the user leaves the page and then comes back, he will be able to continue were he left off.

# üïµüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Testing features

## Features
* customize shirt and add to cart.
* editing a shirt that has ben added to the cart.
* continue customizing when returning to the page.
* live preview of the shirt when user customizes it.

## Test scenarios
* Everything is enabled
* JavaScript and css are disabled

## Chosen browsers
* Chrome 99 on MacOS Big Sur 11.6
* Safari 14 on MacOS Big Sur 11.6
* Safari 14 on Iphone with IOS 15.3.1
* Chrome 75 on Nexus 5 with Android 6

## Key conclusions
* Core functionality will always work.
* Flexbox is not fully supported on the Nexus 5. So had to use a @supports in CSS.
* When using safari, user has to set the tab function on in his preferences. This improves the accesibility if it's turned on.
